\begin{abstract}
  Trusted execution environments (TEEs) like Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX)
  offer a promising avenue for securing applications by executing them within secure enclaves.
  However, recent advancements in side-channel attack techniques, such as SGX-Step,
  pose significant threats to the security guarantees provided by SGX.
  SGX-Step uses the APIC timer to precisely interrupt the enclave after each instruction,
  effectively stepping through the execution one instruction at a time.
  These single-stepping capabilities allow much greater granularity for side-channel,
  thereby enhancing the feasibility of side-channel attacks.
  In response to this threat, AEX-Notify has been proposed as a potential mitigation against SGX-Step.
  AEX-Notify is both a hardware extension and a software mitigation that tries
  to prevent adversaries from single-stepping enclaves.
  This paper analyzes the security of AEX-Notify and evaluates its
  effectiveness against deterministic single-stepping.
\end{abstract}

\section{Motivation}

Modern computing relies heavily on privileged system software to manage interactions and ensure security.
However, traditional operating system kernels are susceptible to bugs and vulnerabilities
due to their large codebase written in unsafe languages.
To address this, recent research has focused on Protected Module Architectures (PMAs),
aiming to support isolated execution of security-sensitive components
called enclaves with minimal Trusted Computing Base (TCB).
Intelâ€™s Software Guard eXtensions (SGX) \cite{Intel16,Intel17} represent a significant advancement,
providing hardware-enforced trusted computing guarantees.
However, vulnerabilities have emerged, particularly in information leakage
through attacks exploiting various system components.
These vulnerabilities undermine the security promises of SGX.

SGX-Step presents a novel framework to address SGX vulnerabilities by enabling
precise monitoring of enclave execution at the instruction level.
Unlike previous methods, SGX-Step achieves true single-stepping for any enclave program,
significantly enhancing the resolution of existing attacks.
The framework comprises a Linux kernel driver and a runtime library,
providing the means to interrupt enclave execution at the instruction level
for detailed observation and analysis.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Formulation of the \textbf{research question}:
    Is it possible to gather control-flow information of victim programs running
    in SGX enclaves when the victim protects the execution of the enclave with
    AEX-Notify?
  \item \textbf{Project goals}:
    Our goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of AEX-Notify against SGX-step by
    constructing an example program where the SGX-Step attack works and testing
    this program once with AEX-Notify enabled and once without. We will compare
    the results to see how much information we can gain about control-flow
    information with and without AEX-Notify enabled.
\end{itemize}

\section{Background}

This section provides a comprehensive review of existing research and frameworks
relevant to the evaluation of AEX-Notify against SGX single-stepping attackers.
In particular, we outline the workings of Intel SGX and
discuss how SGX-Step leverages the APIC timer to single-step enclaves.
Following this, we examine CopyCat, which leverages SGX-Step to extract
control-flow information from enclaves, highlighting potential security
vulnerabilities.
Finally, we look into the details of AEX-Notify and
how it prevents the single-stepping capabilities of SGX-Step.

\subsection{Intel SGX}

Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is a security feature introduced by Intel
that enables the creation of secure enclaves within applications \cite{CostanD16}.
Enclaves provide a protected execution environment for sensitive code and data,
ensuring confidentiality and integrity even if the host system is compromised.
Key components of SGX include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Memory Management:}
    SGX enforces memory isolation between enclaves and non-enclave code,
    preventing unauthorized access to enclave data.
  \item \textbf{Interrupt/Exception Handling:}
    When an interrupt occurs, it triggers an AEX (Asynchronous Enclave eXit),
    which saves the application state in the current SSA.
    However, the enclave application has no mechanism (without AEX-Notify) to detect an interrupt.
  \item \textbf{TCS, SSA, TCS.CSSA:}
    SGX defines structures such as Thread Control Structure (TCS) and Saved State Area (SSA)
    to manage enclave execution and state transitions.
    \texttt{TCS.CSSA} refers to the current saved state area within the TCS.
  \item \textbf{EENTER, EEXIT:}
    SGX instructions for entering and exiting enclaves,
    facilitating the secure transition of control flow between enclave and non-enclave code.
  \item \textbf{Security Goals:}
    It's important to note that the primary goal of SGX is to protect
    the confidentiality and integrity of enclave data and code,
    rather than providing defenses against side-channel attacks,
    which are the responsibility of enclave developers \cite{CostanD16}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SGX-Step}

SGX-Step \cite{BulckPS17} is a framework designed to address vulnerabilities in SGX
by enabling precise monitoring of enclave execution at the instruction level.
It utilizes the APIC timer to interrupt enclave execution at specific intervals,
allowing for detailed observation and analysis.
Previous methods for interrupting enclave execution often resulted in large time jitter,
making it difficult to precisely control the timing of interrupts.
SGX-Step overcomes these challenges by configuring the APIC timer in user space,
enabling finer control over interrupt timing and reducing time jitter \cite{ArnautovTGKMPLM16}.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{images/sgx-step-pte.pdf}
  \caption{Overview of the SGX-Step attack.
    After resuming execution, the enclave has to lookup the pages for
    the instruction itself and the \texttt{rdi} operand. This increases the time
    for the instruction and therefore the likelihood that an interrupts arrives
    during the execution of that instruction.}
  \label{fig:sgx-step-pte}
\end{figure}

\todo[inline]{Add paragraph for monitoring page table entries and how SGX-Step
  uses it to start single-stepping once a specific page has been executed.}
\todo[inline]{Explain why SGX-Step is important $\to$ It enables side-channel attacks at instruction-level granularity}

\subsection{CopyCat}

CopyCat \cite{MoghimiBHPS20} utilizes the SGX-Step framework
to infer fine-grained control-flow information from SGX enclaves.
It improves upon traditional page-fault adversaries,
that can only page accesses at a 4 KiB resolution,
with the single-stepping capabilities of SGX-Step.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{square-and-multiply.pdf}
  \caption{A typical implementation of the exponentiation function using square and multiply.
    The function calculates $c^d$ where $c$ and $d$ are natural numbers.
    It is important to note that \emph{square} and \emph{multiply} are separate functions
    and may reside on different pages than the exponentiation function.}
  \label{fig:square-and-multiply}
\end{figure}

In a typical square-and-multiply implementation,
we can use page faults to extract the key.
On each iteration we can induce a fault by clearing the execute permission on
the page with the \emph{square} function.
Tracking access in each iteration, we can fully recover the key from only page faults.

Traditional page-fault adversaries fail at recovering the key when the entire
square-and-multiply procedure fits on a single page.
CopyCat overcomes this challenge by single-stepping the enclave and counting the
number of instructions until a data page was accessed.
In the example of square-and-multiply, there are two data accesses of interest.
The first is the access to the cipher text that is squared on each iteration.
The second is the write to the output whenever the key bit is one.
By counting the number of instructions between each data access,
CopyCat can recover the key even if the cipher text, output and key are on the same page.

\todo[inline]{Add paragraph explaining why this is a problem in the context of
  the SGX attacker model. Because technically side-channel attacks are not a
  concern for SGX, but they still implemented AEX-Notify.}

\subsection{AEX-Notify}
\label{sec:aex-notify}

To counter SGX-Step and the attack vectors that it enables, AEX-Notify has been proposed.
The purpose of AEX-Notify is to stop attackers from reliably single-stepping an enclave,
which mitigates many attacks based on SGX-Step like CopyCat.

Constable et al. \cite{ConstableBCXXAK23} list the root cause behind the effectiveness of SGX-Step as the assisted page-table walk.
Before resuming the enclave, the SGX-Step attack clears the accessed bit on the pages,
which causes a page fault when executing the first instruction.
This induces additional latency in the execution of the instruction, because
the processor has to walk the page table again.
Thus, there is a large time frame where the interrupt of the timer could
arrive and land exactly on the first instruction.
The goal of AEX-Notify is to reduce the latency of the first instruction
and make it impossible to reliably land on the first instruction.

The first part of AEX-Notify is the hardware extension.
It introduces a new flag in the SSA frame, called \texttt{AEXNOTIFY}.
By enabling this flag, we change the behavior of the \texttt{ERESUME} instruction.
Usually, \texttt{ERESUME} restores the previous process context,
however, when the \texttt{AEXNOTIFY} bit is enabled,
a custom exception handler is executed.
The exception handler is responsible for handling the AEX and
can resume the enclave application with an additional instruction, called \texttt{EDECCSSA}.
This instruction decrements \texttt{TCS.CSSA} and restores the context of the enclave application.

The second part of AEX-Notify is the custom exception handler that is implemented in software.
The exception handler is split into two stages.
The first stage is responsible for decoding the first instruction and
computing the accessed pages of that instruction.
It is run with AEX-Notify disabled.
The second stage is responsible for prefetching the addresses from the first stage.
It is further split into two parts.
The first part runs with AEX-Notify disabled
and the second, smaller assembly stub runs with AEX-Notify enabled.
AEX-Notify is disabled at first to ensure that the exception handler always makes forward progress.

\section{Work Description}

Our main goal is to analyze the effectiveness of AEX-Notify
in preventing attackers from reliably single-stepping SGX enclaves.
To evaluate the success of AEX-Notify in achieving this,
we conducted an analysis aimed at identifying any potential weak points in its implementation.
This section outlines the steps we took in our evaluation process,
beginning with the setup of the SGX-Step attack and the subsequent enabling of AEX-Notify on this attacker.
By examining these components,
we aimed to provide an informed assessment of AEX-Notifyâ€™s defensive capabilities.
This analysis informs us about potential attack vectors to try,
offering insights into areas that may require further study.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

Since AEX-Notify consists of a hardware and software part,
we need a system that specifically supports the hardware extension.
This section outlines the hardware and software specifications of the experimental environment,
including configuration details necessary for conducting the evaluation.

\textbf{Hardware and Software Specifications:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Intel Core i7 10th Gen, 16GB DDR4 RAM, and SSD storage.
  \item Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Linux kernel version 5.10) with SGX driver support. Use SGX SDK for enclave development.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Configuration Details:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Configure SGX environment with appropriate BIOS settings and SGX driver installation.
    Utilize SGX SDK for enclave development.
  \item
    Set up the environment to execute the single-stepping attack.
    Select target enclaves and configure attack parameters for testing.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Initializing SGX-Step}

\todo[inline]{Explain kernel module, \texttt{/dev/sgx-step}, etc.}

SGX-Step requires careful configuration of the APIC timer
since it is crucial for the attack to work.
If the value is too small, then we will zero-step and execute the same instruction multiple times.
If the value is too large, then we will multi-step and execute multiple instruction.
We have used an example application provided in the SGX-Step repository for this purpose.
This example consists only of a series of \texttt{nop} instructions and
reports the instruction pointer after each interrupt using the \texttt{EDBRD}.
If the instruction pointer is incremented by one instruction each interrupt,
then we can be sure that we are single-stepping the enclave.

\subsection{Implementation Details for Applying AEX-Notify}

After configuring SGX-Step and successfully single-stepping the enclave, we enabled AEX-Notify on the example.
We can enable AEX-Notify by simply adding an additional field in the enclave configuration file.
Enabling this flag requires registering an exception handler for any enclave exit that occurs.
However, the exception handler is preconfigured to use the provided handler
from the trusted runtime system of the Intel SGX SDK.
This is the exact same exception handler as described in Section~\ref{sec:aex-notify},
which decodes the enclave return point and prefetches the necessary code and data pages.

After enabling AEX-Notify, we were particularly interested in the reported addresses from the benchmark application.
Usually, we can use these addresses to configure the timer
since each address is incremented by one when the timer is configured correctly.
The problem with AEX-Notify is that interrupting the enclave not only
interrupts the enclave but it can also interrupt the exception handler.
In this case, the application will additionally report addresses from the exception handler.
For these addresses, it is not entirely clear where exactly there are from.
Therefore, we have written a simple tool that uses the debug information from the binary and
automatically translates these addresses to their source code location in the trusted runtime system.

goes when the exception handler is interrupted and also why it's important.}

  \subsection{Single-stepping Attack Implementation}

  The single-stepping attack, also known as the Zigzagger attack,
  aims to exploit vulnerabilities in SGX enclaves
  by interrupting enclave execution at precise intervals.
  This section provides a detailed overview of the Zigzagger attack methods and a step-by-step implementation guide.

  \textbf{Introduction to Zigzagger Attack Methods:}
  The Zigzagger attack utilizes techniques to interrupt SGX enclave execution at the instruction level,
  thereby enabling the extraction of control-flow information.
  It involves precise timing to resume execution either before or after specific instructions,
  allowing an attacker to gather sensitive information.

  \textbf{Step-by-step Implementation Guide:}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Identifying Target Enclaves:} The first step involves selecting target SGX enclaves susceptible to single-stepping attacks.
    \item \textbf{Setting Interrupt Intervals:} Determine the optimal timing intervals for interrupting enclave execution to capture control-flow information effectively.
    \item \textbf{Implementing Interruption Mechanism:} Develop the mechanism to interrupt enclave execution using techniques such as APIC timers.
    \item \textbf{Fine-tuning Timing:} Adjust timing parameters to ensure the interruption occurs at critical points during enclave execution.
    \item \textbf{Testing and Validation:} Validate the implementation by running test scenarios to verify the effectiveness of the single-stepping attack in extracting control-flow information.
  \end{enumerate}

\section{Results}

As the most basic requirement,
we were no longer able to single-step the enclave after enabling AEX-Notify.
Using a page-fault, we could always reliably interrupt the application
before executing the first instruction of the target code.
However, it was not possible to reliably execute one or even multiple instructions after the first.

The application reports the instruction pointer of the enclave
and after reporting the first instruction of our target code correctly,
we could only see addresses that were in the exception handler.
This means that each interrupt always arrives too soon and
lands in the exception handler instead of the enclave itself.

We were able to observe different behavior depending on the number of
\texttt{nop} instructions that the enclave executed.
If the number of instructions do not fit on a single page,
then the most of the addresses would end up during the C3 cache.

We were able to verify that the exception handler is always rolled back to the first phase of the exception handler
even if the handler itself is interrupted.
By inserting a page-fault after the assembly stub re-enables AEX-Notify,
we were able to detect that the exception handler is reset completely,
i.e. it starts from the first phase.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Where does the exception handler rollback when interrupting the small assembly stub?
    It goes back to the original exception handler, i.e. the first stage and not the second stage.
  \item \textbf{TODO}: Can we differentiate between zero-step and multi-step by simulating a cache attack?
\end{itemize}
